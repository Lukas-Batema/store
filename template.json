Join a game of kahoot on your computer or mobile device - all you need is an internet connection and a game PIN. Kahoot! brings fun into the classroom - play, learn and unleash your secret classroom superpowers!

Kahoot! is a game-based learning platform that makes learning awesome. The best way to play Kahoot! is in a group, like your classroom. Questions appear on a shared screen and you answer on your own device. 

Many games (we call them ‘kahoots’) are designed as quizzes with multiple choice questions. Another type is a Jumble game where you have to put answers in the correct order - stay focused, precision is king here! But the faster you answer, the more points you can get. Discuss and celebrate together - it’s going to be loud! 

Playing Kahoot! is really simple:
- Enter the game PIN that you see once the host has launched the kahoot. You don’t even need to create an account!
- On the next step, type your nickname.
- All ready to go! Look up to the shared screen and use your device as the controller to answer the questions.
- See how many points you got and where you’re standing on the scoreboard as you play. Next stop - top spot.

Enjoyed playing? Create your own kahoot on the topic and challenge your classmates! If you want to create or host a kahoot on your computer, get the Kahoot! Create app from Microsoft Store. 

Have fun playing and learning! And remember - victory is closer than you think. ",
